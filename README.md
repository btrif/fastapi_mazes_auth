##           FAST Maze API

####  Description:

A small app which handles user authentication with token.
You can create your own user then authenticate and create mazes.
After that you can solve them using either min or max paths. The min
will be the minimum path and max for the maximum path. Behind the scenes
there are BFS algorithms.
